The Windrush scandal refers to a series of events in the United Kingdom that affected the Windrush generation and their descendants, who faced wrongful detention, deportation, and denial of basic rights despite being legally entitled to live and work in the country. This website aims to educate and raise awareness about this issue by providing a centralized platform for information, stories, and resources.
